# corgi-tama-frontend

Howdy 90’s kids!!! Remember TamaGotchis??? Great! Who doesn’t???
Ever wanted to own a corgi, but for some reason you can’t?
Well now you can have the best of both worlds!
My project is inspired by TamaGotchis and my corgi Anakin. You can adopt your own happy lil corgi and play with them until they grow up and have to leave to the big city to provide for the family!

You can find the repo to my backend here: https://github.com/saleman25/corgi-tama-backend.git  

# Installation
Fork and Clone this repository. You will need to setup the rails api back-end to get the application working properly. Once you have your API up and running you will need to alter the BASEURL constant in index.js to match the url which your API server is running on. After that open index.html in your browser.

# Usage
This application is made to be used in tandem with the rails api backend. Once your server is up and running and you have index.html open in the browser:
Just enter in your name and have fun!
